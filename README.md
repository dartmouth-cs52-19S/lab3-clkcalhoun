## Note Site

I created implemented the basics of the lab 3 assignment. I did not attempt extra credit. I did some styling that I thought came out well. The opacitiy allows you to see notes on top of each other and read the one you are hovering over. There are a few things that are sub-ideal like the sizing of some components and how the notes move around when one with a lower id gets longer or shorter.

* I drew inspiration from SA4 as I started out.
